## Via User Secrets / Json

You can get a basic and complete User Secrets Json for Veni from the [Engineering Staff information forum](https://discord.com/channels/768923191073701909/1079181729337716808/1079181729337716808).
Where `.` appears in a Setting Name it indicates a value within an object. For example, `Clu.RuntimeKey` would imply a `Clu` object (`{}`) with a `RuntimeKey` value within. 
Also, note that setting names are case-sensitive.
